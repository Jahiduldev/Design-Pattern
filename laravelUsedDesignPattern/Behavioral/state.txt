The State pattern in Laravel is used to allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
 This pattern is particularly useful when you have an object that needs to exhibit different behaviors based on its internal state,
  without changing its class.

In Laravel, the State pattern is often used in conjunction with Eloquent models to represent different states of entities in a system.

How State Pattern Works in Laravel:
State Classes: Define classes that represent different states of an object. Each state class encapsulates the behavior associated with that state.

Context Class: Create a context class that maintains a reference to the current state and delegates behavior to the state objects.

State Transition: Allow the context class to transition between different states based on certain conditions or events.

Example:
Let's consider an example of using the State pattern to represent different states of a blog post in Laravel.
