The Observer pattern in Laravel is used to implement a publish-subscribe mechanism where multiple objects (observers) are notified of changes
to the state of a subject (observable). Laravel's event system is built around the Observer pattern, allowing you to dispatch events and
listen for those events elsewhere in your application.

How Observer Pattern Works in Laravel:
Event Dispatching: In Laravel, you can dispatch events using the Event facade or the global event() helper function.
These events represent specific occurrences or changes within your application.

Event Listeners: You can define event listeners to handle specific events and perform actions in response to those events.
Event listeners are responsible for subscribing to events and reacting to them.

Decoupling: The Observer pattern in Laravel promotes loose coupling between components by allowing them to communicate through events without
needing direct references to each other.

Example:
Let's consider an example where a user is registered, and we want to dispatch an event when the registration process is successful.
