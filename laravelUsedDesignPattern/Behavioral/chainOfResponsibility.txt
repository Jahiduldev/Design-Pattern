Middleware:
Middleware in Laravel can be thought of as a Chain of Responsibility.
Middleware provides a convenient mechanism for filtering HTTP requests entering your application.
Each middleware component can perform operations on the request and then decide to either pass the request further along the chain or stop processing and return a response.
Middleware allows you to chain multiple classes together, with each one capable of processing the request or response before passing it on.

HTTP Kernel:
The HTTP Kernel in Laravel is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and directing them to the appropriate route and middleware.
Within the HTTP Kernel, middleware classes are arranged in an array. When a request comes in, Laravel passes it through each middleware in the order they are defined in the kernel.
Each middleware in the chain can either handle the request or pass it to the next middleware in the chain.

Event Handling:
Laravel's event system also implements a form of the Chain of Responsibility pattern.
Events in Laravel allow you to subscribe listeners or callbacks to be executed when a particular event occurs.
These listeners are organized in a chain, and each listener can handle the event or pass it along to the next listener in the chain.

While Laravel doesn't explicitly call out the use of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in its documentation, these components and features demonstrate its usage indirectly.
The framework leverages this pattern to provide a flexible and extensible architecture for handling HTTP requests, events, and other interactions within the application.
