The Bridge pattern in Laravel is often used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
 In Laravel, you may see the Bridge pattern used in various scenarios where you want to separate an abstraction (such as an interface or abstract class) from its concrete implementations, allowing them to change independently without affecting each other.
