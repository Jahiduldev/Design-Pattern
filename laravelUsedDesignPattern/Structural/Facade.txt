In Laravel, the Facade pattern is a structural design pattern used to provide a static interface to classes that are available in the application's service container.
Laravel's facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container,
allowing you to access these classes in a more expressive and convenient manner.

How Facades Work in Laravel:
Static Interface: Laravel's facades provide a static interface to classes registered in the service container,
allowing you to access their methods without needing to instantiate them.

Dynamic Method Resolution: When you call a method on a facade, Laravel dynamically resolves the underlying class from the service container
and delegates the method call to it.

Expressive Syntax: Facades provide a clean and expressive syntax for accessing various components and services within the Laravel framework.
